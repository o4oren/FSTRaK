FSTrAk is a modern flight tracker and logbook for MSFS (and possibly FSX/P3D, although not tested).
It aims to be a no frills, install and let it run experience - as it requires no manual intervention.
FSTrAk monitors your simulator silently, and will detect when a flight is started, track it on a map, and persist it to a local database when it is complete.
