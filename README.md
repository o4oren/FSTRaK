FSTrAk is a modern flight tracker and logbook for MSFS (and possibly FSX/P3D, although not tested).
It aims to be a no frills, install and let it run experience - as it requires no manual intervention.
FSTrAk monitors your simulator silently, and will detect when a flight is started, track it on a map, and persist it to a local database when it is complete.

## Features
* Automatic silent start-up.
* Automatic flight tracking (hands-free experience).
* Option (default) to save only complete flights - i.e. flight ended in parking states, with engines off and parking breaks, after having flown.
* Different map providers.
* Flight analysis and scoring.
* Live flight tracking with a moving map.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Simbrief integration (fetch passengers, planned vs actual fuel and time, planned vs actual route).
- [ ] Statistics (On time, passengers flown, best/worst landings, average faps, average score)
- [ ] Vastsim integration (display live traffic and atc on the map).
